maxmspSimpleStepSequencer

This bad boy is a simple step sequencer. It's based on a 16-step grid,
which can be modified to allow for complex time signatures and measure
lengths. Tempo of the pattern can also be modified.

A sound sample can be loaded into each of eight slots and then added to
the grid as desired. Volume of each individual track can be modified,
as well as volume for the overall output.

It's currently in an unfinished state, and only 2/8 slots are wired up.
Would be a simple task to finish, though.
